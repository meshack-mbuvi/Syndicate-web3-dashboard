        <p className="mb-3 text-gray-300 opacity-80 font-whyte-light">Culture is the Future of Money and Asset Management. Culturally dynamic crypto technology:</p>
        <ol className="list-decimal mb-3 text-gray-300 opacity-80 pl-8 font-whyte-light">
            <li className="mb-2">Unlocks multi $T markets in overlooked regions and industries (i.e. remittances).</li>
            <li className="mb-2">Builds global first solutions for unbanked and underserved markets (i.e. CELO).</li>
            <li className="mb-2">Scales crypto and Web 3.0 to the next 100M people, founders, and investors (i.e. NFTs).</li>
            <li className="mb-2">Drives wealth and ownership for the global majority (i.e. DeFi).</li>
